Info:
VHF (130 - 170 MHz) Channelsize 25 kHz
UHF (400 - 470 MHz) Channelsize 50 kHz
S-band (2.2 - 2.5 GHz) Channelsize up to 1 MHz
X-Band (8 - 12.5 GHz) Channelsize up to 100 MHz
Ku Band (12.5 - 18 HHz) Channelsize 100 MHz (multiple channels may be combined)
K Band (18 - 26.5 GHz) Channelsize 100 MHz (multiple channels may be combined)
Ka Band (26.5 - 40 GHz) Channelsize 100 MHz (multiple channels may be combined)

VHF & UHF mainly used for TM/TC (telemetry&telecommand) low datarate, suited for small satellites
- Hard to get spectrum, need big antenna for reasonable gain
- not really suited for high performance due to low bandwidth

S-band used for TM/TC on uSats or Payload data medium datarate, high efficiency
- Most used for 'low bandwidth'
- Available for payload data
- Many components available, so cheap, high performance solutions

X-band: high cost and not small and beyond is too large

S-band probably best choice
